# Unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe


This is a **web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game** where you play against an **unbeatable AI** powered by the **Minimax algorithm**. The AI always plays optimally and will never lose — it can only win or force a tie. The project is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and is fully deployable on platforms like **Vercel**.
